   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mahak-10/Expense-Tracker.git
   cd Expense-Tracker
   
2. **Configure PostgreSQL Database**

1. **Create a database** in PostgreSQL (e.g., `expense_tracker`).  
2. **Update `application.properties`** with your database URL, username, and password:
   
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/expense_tracker
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

3. **Build and Run the Application**


## Test APIs

- **Sample requests and responses** are already saved in the collection for easy testing.

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**  
- **Spring Boot**  
- **PostgreSQL**  
- **ModelMapper**  
- **Maven**  
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## Notes

  - **Controllers**  
  - **Services**  
  - **Service Implementations**  
  - **Repositories**  
  - **Models**  
  - **DTOs**
